# SA-DS

## Description

SA-DS is a project that introduces a comprehensive dataset tailored for DNN-Accelerators, marking a stride towards automating DNN (AI) Accelerators. This dataset is designed to support the training, fine-tuning, and employment of multi-short prompt inputs for Large Language Models (LLMs). For an in-depth understanding of the project's objectives and methodologies, we highly recommend reviewing our accompanying paper available at [this link](archive-link).
